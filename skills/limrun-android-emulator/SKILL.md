# Limrun Android Emulator

Interact with an app running on a Limrun cloud Android emulator, from any
environment (Linux, Windows, macOS, VM, container). This skill is
build-agnostic: it assumes the APK was already built, usually by
**limrun-gradle**. Keep build concerns in that skill; this one is about
driving the running emulator.

Never use a local emulator, a local Android SDK, or Android Studio.

## Auth and CLI

Install if needed: `npm install --global lim`. Auth is `lim login` or
`LIM_API_KEY` (it may be set outside the project, so don't ask for it just
because it's missing from `.env` or the shell). The CLI is the source of truth:
the commands in this skill are verified, but if a flag errors or you need one
not shown here, check `lim android <subcommand> --help` instead of guessing.

## Installing an app

You can build with Limrun's remote Gradle service and have the APK installed
on a fresh emulator automatically, or install a pre-built local APK or a URL.
One default to know first: `lim android create` opens an ADB tunnel
(`--connect`) and a browser tab with the live stream (`--open`) unless told
otherwise. As an agent, pass `--no-open` always, and `--no-connect` unless you
need adb right away.

### Build and install

Upload the APK built by **limrun-gradle** as a named asset, then create an
emulator with it pre-installed:

```bash
lim gradle build . --upload myapp.apk
lim android create --install-asset myapp.apk --no-open --no-connect
```

Create blocks until the instance is ready to drive; no boot wait is needed.
The create output includes a signed stream URL; share it with the user as a
Markdown link, like [Live emulator](<signed-stream-url>). If you have a
browser the user can see, open the URL there and tell them. Create also
prints a console URL: it opens the same live view but requires a console
login, so prefer the signed stream URL for sharing.

Useful create flags: `--reuse-if-exists` (reuse a running instance with the
same labels), `--rm` (delete when the CLI exits), `--jurisdiction us|eu|as`
(where the instance runs; don't use `--region`, it is deprecated),
`--inactivity-timeout` / `--hard-timeout`, `--display-name`, and `--label k=v`
(find labeled instances later with `lim android list --label-selector k=v`).

### Install app from local

Create a new emulator, then install a local file or a URL:

```bash
lim android create --no-open --no-connect
lim android install-app ./app-debug.apk
lim android install-app https://example.com/app.apk
```

A local path is uploaded to Limrun Asset Storage first; a URL is fetched by
the instance itself, which is much faster for large APKs than uploading from
your machine. `install-app` returns as soon as the app is sent; the install
finishes in the background within seconds. Newly installed apps land in the
app drawer, not the home screen, so don't look for their icon; just launch
the app with `lim android launch-app <package> --detach` (without `--detach`
it blocks watching the app until it exits), or confirm over adb with
`pm list packages | grep <name>`.

Every time you need to install a new version of the APK, sync it instead of
reinstalling:

```bash
lim android sync ./app-debug.apk
```

It sends only a delta against the APK already on the instance, then
reinstalls. `--watch` keeps re-syncing on file changes, and
`--launch-mode ForegroundIfRunning|RelaunchIfRunning` controls what happens to
the running app after each install.

## Targeting the right instance

Most `lim android` commands default to the last created instance and resolve
the "current" one from the **git repo / worktree** of your cwd. In a different
directory (or outside any git repo) a command can report that no recent
instance was found even though one is running. The reliable recipe:

```bash
lim android list                          # shows all instances and their IDs
lim android element-tree --id <that-id>   # pass --id to EVERY lim android command
```

Once you have the ID (format `android_<region>_<ulid>`), pass
`--id <android-instance-id>` to all `lim android` calls for the rest of the
session. Alternatively, `git init` the project so the workspace resolves on
its own. When controlling multiple instances, always pass `--id`.

## Launching the app

Launch and stop installed apps by package name:

```bash
lim android launch-app com.example.app --detach                  # launch and return
lim android launch-app com.example.app                           # launch and watch until it exits
lim android launch-app com.example.app --mode RelaunchIfRunning  # restart for a clean state
lim android terminate-app com.example.app                        # stop it, e.g. to reset app state
```

Without `--detach`, `launch-app` blocks watching the app: when it crashes,
ANRs, or is stopped, the command prints the exit reason, crash details with
the stack trace, and a recent app log tail, then returns. That report is the
way to see why an app died without adb; logs while the app is running still
need adb (below). There is no `list-apps`; discover package names over adb
with `pm list packages`, or take the application ID from the build.

## Logs, files, and shell over adb

Logcat, file transfer, and arbitrary shell go through plain `adb` over the
CLI's tunnel. Start the tunnel in a background shell and keep it alive:

```bash
lim android connect        # prints "Tunnel started on 127.0.0.1:<port>."
```

`connect` runs `adb connect` for you (use `--adb-path` if adb isn't on PATH).
The printed `127.0.0.1:<port>` is the device serial; pass it with `-s` to
every adb call (`adb devices` also lists it):

```bash
SERIAL=127.0.0.1:<port>
adb -s $SERIAL logcat -d | tail -100                             # dump recent logs, don't stream into context
adb -s $SERIAL logcat -d --pid=$(adb -s $SERIAL shell pidof -s com.example.app) | tail -50   # only the app's logs (app must be running)
adb -s $SERIAL shell pm list packages | grep example             # package name discovery
adb -s $SERIAL push ./fixture.json /sdcard/Download/
adb -s $SERIAL pull /sdcard/Download/out.json ./
```

The tunnel lives and dies with the process that started it: when that shell
exits, `adb devices` shows the serial as `offline` while the instance keeps
running. Just run `lim android connect` again to get a new tunnel (the port
changes each time). Stale offline serials are harmless; `adb disconnect`
clears them.

## Testing changes

When emulator interaction is part of the task, test new or changed
functionality with the interaction commands after each install or sync. Focus
on what changed, plus a quick smoke test of core flows. Start by reading the
element tree to see what's on screen before acting:

```bash
lim android element-tree
```

The output is the raw UIAutomator XML hierarchy on a single line, so a plain
grep echoes the whole document. Split it into one node per line first, then
grep for the `text`, `resource-id`, `content-desc`, or `bounds` you need
rather than dumping the whole tree into context:

```bash
lim android element-tree | sed 's/></>\n</g' | grep -i "save"
```

## Interacting with the app

Prefer tapping by resource id, then by visible text or content description,
then coordinates as a last resort:

```bash
lim android tap-element --resource-id com.example.app:id/startButton
lim android tap-element --text "Save"
lim android tap-element --content-desc "Open menu"
lim android tap 360 800
```

Selector values match **exactly**, not by substring: `--text "Save"` does not
match a "Save draft" button. Copy the value verbatim from `element-tree`. A
selector that matches nothing fails in a couple of seconds with
`No element found for selector`. Other selectors: `--class-name`,
`--package-name`, `--index`, `--clickable`, `--enabled`, `--focused`, and
`--bounds-contains-x/y`; combine them to narrow a match. On web pages in the
browser, resource ids are the page's own DOM ids (like `searchIcon`) and are
often empty; select by `--text` plus `--class-name` there, or fall back to
coordinates from the node's `bounds`. To inspect matches without tapping, use
`find-element` with the same selectors:

```bash
lim android find-element --text "Save"   # table of matches with bounds
```

For text input, target the field directly; no prior focus tap is needed.
`type` takes the same selectors as `tap-element` (`--class-name
android.widget.EditText --focused` works for a field with no resource id):

```bash
lim android type "hello world" --resource-id com.example.app:id/searchBox
lim android type "hello" --x 360 --y 400   # by coordinate
lim android press-key enter
lim android press-key backspace            # --modifier shift/control/alt/command to combine
```

For scrolling and navigation:

```bash
lim android scroll down --amount 600
lim android scroll up --amount 300
lim android press-key back
lim android press-key home
lim android open-url "https://example.com"   # opens in the default browser; also fires deep links
```

After every interaction, re-run `element-tree` to confirm the UI transitioned.
No sleep is needed between a tap and `element-tree`; the tap blocks until
done. A page load after `open-url` is asynchronous though: re-run
`element-tree` until the node you expect appears. A present but childless
`android.webkit.WebView` means the page is still loading, not a broken tree.

```bash
lim android element-tree
```

### When the element tree is empty

Some React Native and Expo apps expose no accessibility nodes at all, which
leaves `element-tree`, `tap-element`, and `find-element` blind (system dialogs
still expose nodes). Fall back to driving by pixels: take a screenshot, read
the coordinates of the target, and use `tap x y` / `type --x --y`. Screenshot
pixels map 1:1 to tap coordinates, so a button centered at (360, 1322) in the
image is tapped with `lim android tap 360 1322`. Re-screenshot after each
action to confirm the result.

## Screenshots and video

Screenshot takes a **positional path** (not `-o`):

```bash
lim android screenshot screenshot.png
lim android screenshot screenshot.png --id <android-instance-id>
```

Use the element tree for functional assertions (element existence, text, state
changes) and screenshots only for visual properties. For anything involving
motion (animations, gameplay, streaming UI), prefer video:

```bash
lim android record start                     # non-blocking
lim android record stop -o /tmp/recording.mp4
```

`record stop` accepts `--quality 5-10`. Recorded frames are half the
screenshot resolution, so read tap coordinates from screenshots, never from
video frames. For UI changes, include a demo video in the pull request so the
user can see it.

## Simulate the microphone with an audio file

For voice-driven flows (assistants, speech-to-text, audio calls), play a local
audio file as the emulator's microphone. The app hears the audio through its
normal capture pipeline:

```bash
lim android play-on-microphone ./fixtures/command.wav          # loops by default
lim android play-on-microphone ./fixtures/command.mp3 --once
```

WAV and MP3 work. The file is pushed over adb, so this command needs a local
`adb` binary (`--adb-path` if it's not on PATH) and opens its own short-lived
tunnel. Camera injection is iOS-only; for camera-driven test flows use
**limrun-ios-simulator**.

## Shape network bandwidth

Test slow-network behavior by capping the instance's Wi-Fi bandwidth:

```bash
lim android set-wifi-bandwidth --down-kbps 1000 --up-kbps 500
lim android set-wifi-bandwidth --down-kbps 0 --up-kbps 0       # 0 clears the limit
```

## Preview URL for humans

Upload the APK to Limrun Asset Storage and return a preview URL for the user
to open and test the app manually in the browser:

```bash
export ASSET_NAME=myapp.apk   # can be any name
lim asset push ./app-debug.apk -n ${ASSET_NAME}

echo "https://console.limrun.com/preview?asset=${ASSET_NAME}&platform=android"
```

Opening the link in the Limrun console provisions an emulator with the APK
pre-installed.

## Cleanup

When the work is completed, you can delete the emulator. `delete` takes a
**positional** ID (`--id` is not a valid flag here, unlike other commands):

```bash
lim android delete <android-instance-id>
```

## Gotchas

- **The fleet is x86_64.** Emulators report `x86_64,arm64-v8a` ABIs and run
  arm64 code through translation, but an APK whose native libraries are
  arm64-only for some vendor SDKs installs fine and then crashes with
  `UnsatisfiedLinkError` when that code first loads. Build with x86_64 native
  libs included.
- **Selectors match exactly.** `tap-element --text` and `find-element --text`
  need the full, exact string from `element-tree`; substrings match nothing.
- **`install-app` returns before the install finishes.** The app lands a few
  seconds later; verify with `find-element` or `pm list packages` before
  launching. Prefer `install-app <URL>` or `create --install-asset` over raw
  `adb install`: a big APK over `adb install` streams with zero progress
  output and looks hung for minutes, and killing it mid-stream corrupts the
  install.
- **The ADB tunnel is session-bound.** It dies with the shell that started it
  while the instance keeps running; reconnect with `lim android connect` and
  re-read the port, it changes every time.
- **Failed create pipes can still leak an instance.** If a `create` invocation
  errors client-side (broken pipe, JSON parse), check `lim android list`; the
  instance may exist anyway and should be deleted.
- **Empty element tree usually means a React Native app**, not a broken
  instance. See "When the element tree is empty" above.
- **`element-tree` can be large.** Pipe through `grep` to extract what you
  need rather than dumping the whole tree into context.
- **Instance resolution can miss in a non-git dir.** See "Targeting the right
  instance" above; pass `--id` when in doubt.
- **Build errors are the build skill's job.** If the APK isn't building, the
  failure is upstream; go back to **limrun-gradle**.
